# SingularSystems

SingularSystems is an innovative platform for tech enthusiasts and professionals to configure and order custom PCs tailored to their specific needs and preferences.

## Introduction

In the evolving world of technology, where off-the-shelf PCs often don't meet the requirements of specialized tasks, SingularSystems aims to bridge the gap. Our platform allows users to select components based on their requirements, ensuring compatibility, and keeping track of the overall price and wattage, thereby providing a seamless and intuitive experience.

## Concept

The core concept behind SingularSystems is to provide a "Lego-like" approach to building PCs:
- **Component Selection**: Users can choose components, from CPUs to PSUs, based on their preferences and needs.
- **Live Price Display**: As users select components, the platform provides a real-time cost calculation, ensuring clarity and transparency.
- **Wattage Check**: The system checks the combined wattage of the components, ensuring that the selected PSU can handle the load.
- **Compatibility Assurance**: The platform ensures that chosen components are compatible, reducing the chances of hardware conflicts.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: The backend of the platform is powered by Django, providing a robust and scalable solution.
  
- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using React, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface.
  
- **Database**: Django's built-in ORM is used to interact with the database, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **API**: Django Rest Framework (DRF) is utilized to serve data to the frontend in a structured and efficient manner.
